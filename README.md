Recently I've came across many programmers who want to create a Facebook App( basically a image manipulation app). So Here am posting a open source code for such aspirants.
Basic tools to run this script

PHP GD library.
PHP mbstring(facebook recommended).
Rewrite mod enabled server.
Bootstrap*.
Jquery*.

*for template only.
